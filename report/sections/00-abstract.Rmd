The aim of this report is to perform a predictive modeling process applied on the data set named _Credit_. Specifically, the 
project performs exploratory data analysis, pre-modeling data processing and builds multiple linear regression models to predict 
the variable **Balance** in terms of ten predictors such as **Income**, **Age**, **Education**, **Gender**, **Ethinicity** etc. The project
is largely based on chapter 6: _Linear Model Selection and Regularization_ from the book **An Introduction to Statistical Learning** 
by James et al.
