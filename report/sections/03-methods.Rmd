####**Methods**
Shrinkage methods means fitting a model involving all p predictors with the estimated coefficients shrunken towards zero relative to the least squares estimates, which has the effect of reducing variance. 

For Ridge regression, we use coefficient estimates values that minimizes RSS with the following equation:

As for Lasso regression, we use the following equation that also shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero:

Dimension reduction methods means projecting the p predictors into a M-dimensional subspace, where M<p. Then these M projections are used as predictors to fit a linear regression model by least squares. 

For Principle Components regression is a technique reducing the dimension of a n Ã— p data matrix X which  involves identifying linear combinations, or directions, that best represent the predictors X1,...,Xp. As for Partial Least square, it's a supervised alternative to PCR in that it attempts to
find directions that help explain both the response and the predictors.
